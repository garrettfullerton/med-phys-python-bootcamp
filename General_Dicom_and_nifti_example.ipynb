    "\n",
    "Working with these files are not required or relavent with in the core carriculum. However, some advanced classes and many areas of research will work closely with these types of file structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook briefly introduces both `DICOM` file formats as well as another commonly-used image storage format `nifti`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python package `pydicom` will be used to read `DICOM` files. `nibabel` will be used to read `nifti` files. Additional inherent packages `os` and `glob` will be used to locate and read file paths from the computer. `matplotlib.pyplot` will be used to visualize the volume while `numpy` will be used to handle the numerical image values.\n",

    "# DICOM\n",
    "\n",
    "Dicom, or Digital Image and Communications in Medicine, file format have the file type `.dcm`. Here, each file contains the image itself, as well as information stored in the file *header*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Headers\n",
    "The header of a file or image contains meta data describing what the image is of, how the image was aquired, and other cruicial information that may be of interest. The meta data is identifiable through their *tags* (Dicom tags).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the medical world, the header will contain additional information about **the Patient scanned.** Patient data, including HIPPA protected data, is stored in the header. When working with Dicom files, the data is *usually* de-identified, stripping the meta-data of all information pertaining to the patient. \n",
    "\n",
    "The elements of the file header are structures like a dictionary, with consistent and well defined locations for imporant aspects of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when working with images, the spatial resolution is an important piece of information to be aware of. The image itself is just some m x n array of pixel values. Within the header, there will exist a specific tag that defines explicitly what spatial measurement corresponds with a single pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **PSA: be mindful of meta-data to not violate Hippa compliance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dicom file format can contain information about and support a wide variety of different objects. For isntance, the optimized radiotherapy plan that contains detailed positional and timing instructions for a linear accelerator to enable someone's radiotherapy can be stored in a dicom file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading a Dicom file\n",
    "For us, most use cases will be in the form of image data. Each dicom file will contain a single 2D image. To read this file, we can use `pydicom`'s `read_file` function, which will read the image and header in to a pydcm object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dicom files extracted from the clinical systems will typically have jargon names. They will be stored in a directory that contains a more user-friendly name, however the actual `.dcm` file may just be a string of numbers.\n",
